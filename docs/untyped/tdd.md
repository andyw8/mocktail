# Using Mocktail for test-driven development

If you plan to use this mocking library as a tool in your test-driven
development workflow, you've come to the right placeâ€”it's what Mocktail was
designed for!

There are several flavors of test-driven development, but the relevant
distinction for figuring out which direction you want to take Mocktail lies
before you:

**Use Mocktail to create [fake instances of Ruby classes](tdd/poro.md) you own.**

**Use Mocktail to [fake out singleton ("class" or "module") methods](tdd/singletons.md) of types you own.**

**Use Mocktail to [fake out third-party code](tdd/third_party.md) you can't readily change.**

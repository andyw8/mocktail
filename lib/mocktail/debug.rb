    # It would be easy and bad for the mocktail lib to call something like

    #   double == other_double

    # But if it's a double, that means anyone who stubs that method could change
    # the internal behavior of the library in unexpected ways (as happened here:
    # https://github.com/testdouble/mocktail/issues/7 )
    #
    # For that reason when we run our tests, we also want to blow up if this
    # happens unintentionally. This works in conjunction with the test
    # MockingMethodfulClassesTest, because it mocks every defined method on the
    # mocked BasicObject
